# DEPRECATED WORKFLOW (build-static.yml)
#
# This workflow has been intentionally disabled and replaced by the unified
# 'Generate & Deploy Site' workflow defined in jekyll-gh-pages.yml.
#
# It remains in the repository only because automated deletion via the current
# assistant tooling did not persist. Safe to remove manually. Keeping it as a
# no-op prevents any accidental duplicate builds or deploys.
#
# To remove: git rm .github/workflows/build-static.yml && git commit -m "chore: remove legacy workflow"
#
# If you trigger this manually it will exit immediately and do nothing.
